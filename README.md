# stock_analysis_VBA

## Summary
This analysis involves a data set collected from the stock market using VBA scripting. The goal of this analysis is to pull information by creating a script that will loop through all the stocks for each individual year of 2014, 2015, and 2016. The information pulled will be:
* The ticker symbol.
* The yearly change from opening price at the beginning of the given year to the closing price at the end of the year.
* The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of the year. 
* The total stock volume of the stock.
* The greatest percent increase.
* The greatest percent decrease.
* The greatest total volume. 

The resulting pulled information will also contain conditioned formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
